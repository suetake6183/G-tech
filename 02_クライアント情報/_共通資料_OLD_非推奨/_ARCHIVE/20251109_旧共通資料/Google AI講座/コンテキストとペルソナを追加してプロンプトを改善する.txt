- I am excited to be here with Laura, Productivity Advisor at Google. So I'm curious, do you have
any tips, any prompting, tips that you would give to our learners on how to get the best out of these systems, things that you tend to go to often? - Just the more context you
give, the better answers you get and the better results. And you know, also continuing
to iterate once it comes back, thinking of it as an ongoing conversation. I like to include things like
the persona saying, you know, I'm looking for a marketing plan. Start by saying, imagine you're a world class marketer, right? And you're marketing for this
budget and this timeline, and really providing a starting point. So maybe this is what you've done before, this is the company's values. And so just the more that
you can give it, you start to realize, wow, I'm, I'm
getting a lot out of it this way. - That's right. You can
even upload, you know, your team's mission statement
and all that context and give that as part
of the prompt as well. - Yeah. I really like the,
the idea that you don't have to start from scratch at the prompt page. So maybe you have a project
plan that you really like, but you're wanting to better it. - Yep.
- You can upload that project plan and say, here's what I've
been using for two years. Yeah. What are some ways
that I could do more? Yep. And that's a great place for it to start. - Yep. Help me expand this
in a certain direction. Help me change course.
