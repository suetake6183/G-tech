- It is my pleasure to be here
with Anoop, Research Director of AI and Future Technologies
on the Technology and Society team at Google. So Anoop, I'm curious,
do you have any tips, how should people get started, what are some of the gotchas
they should watch out for, that sort of thing? - Yeah, I think the first
thing is to remember that they're not perfect and
those mistakes will show up and sometimes they'll show
up in the most subtle ways. If I asked my LLM to
help me write a draft, sometimes it'll write a draft and it'll write a paragraph that it's extremely confident about. And then I just have to know and I have to double check everything because knowing the topic that I'm working on means I can catch it, - Right - and make sure that I'm not taking what the large language model
has suggested as ground truth because it's not, it requires checking. It's also the case, it's very iterative process I think, as well. So whatever my first prompt
might be, it's the iterations that actually extract the
help that I might need or the answers to the
questions that I might have. So I'll usually start with a prompt, but I'm also really quite aware
that I'm gonna be iterating that prompt forward until I get the thing that I actually want. - It's not one and done,
it's a conversation. - It's not one and done
at all. And it's important to be a bit careful that maybe
there's some factual error that's actually being shown. But then also the iteration
is what can get it to be what actually solves
the task that I've got.
