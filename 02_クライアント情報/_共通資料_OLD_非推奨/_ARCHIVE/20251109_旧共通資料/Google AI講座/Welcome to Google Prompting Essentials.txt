teach you the difference between a good prompt and a great prompt, so you can work faster and smarter with gen AI at your side, and we'll share practical examples of where you can use gen AI at work. Hi, I'm Amina. I work on
generative AI at Google. In this course, my colleagues and I are going to teach you how you can get the most out of gen AI. You'll learn when to use gen AI and how by designing better
prompts to get the best results. You'll apply what you've
learned with hands-on activities and quizzes to level up
