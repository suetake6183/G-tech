- Hi, I'm Mira, Senior
Director in Technology and Society at Google. My team imagines and explores the possibilities of using AI to benefit people and society. Throughout this course,
I'll be sitting down with experts at Google
to dive deeper into some of the most exciting topics related to AI. I'm excited to be here with Tris, director of Product Management at Google DeepMind. So let's talk about prompting. Why is it important to
learn prompting right now? - Prompting is completely new. We haven't been able to interact
with computers in this way before. As AI becomes
a much more common part of our lives, as it becomes
part of how you use your phone, your computer, maybe interact
with things around your house and also other people's AI, I think this is the new language. It's the new language by which
we converse with computers. And the amazing part is
that for the first time, computers actually listen to us. They talk the way that we want to talk. We still have to
understand what works best, and I think that's what
prompting is all about. But realistically, this
is a chance for you to bring your own personality,
your own desires directly to AI in all manner of fields. So I think learning the new
language of how to interact with computers couldn't come
at a better time than now.
